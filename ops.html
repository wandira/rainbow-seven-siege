          <h2>Sergeant Foley</h2>
          <p>Sergeant Foley is introduced in "S.S.D.D.", training an Afghan National Army group at Firebase Phoenix, Afghanistan with the aid of translator Private Hamed and fellow Ranger.

          Shortly after Allen's selection training in The Pit for Task Force 141, Foley and his squad are deployed to rescue BCT-One, which is trapped in a militia-held town near Firebase Phoenix. He first leads his squad to defend the bridge layer from large volumes of RPG's fire from the OpFor across the river. After the bridge is laid, he leads his men into the city in Humvees, where they are ambushed by the militia. They put up a good fight, taking down many militiamen, although the Humvee is eventually destroyed. They are then forced to take cover in an enemy-occupied apartment, clearing their way through it. </p>

        <h2>Tanya Pavelovna</h2>
        <p>Tanya's home village of Pitomnik was a small and comparatively isolated community located within the western realm of Russia. 

        Tanya knew little of the war in Europe, even after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Her home village of Pitomnik was small and isolated, cut off from the everyday realities of what would become known to all Russians as The Great Patriotic War.
        
        The date on which German Armed Forces entered and took the village of Pitomnik is unknown.  Fleeing through the woods, she was picked up by a patrol from the Red Army. She joined up soon after.
        
        A patrol Tanya was a part of was ambushed and cut to pieces by the Germans, forcing her to take shelter in a collapsed building. There, she discovered a scoped Mosin-Nagant rifle alongside a fallen comrade. Allegedly with the voice of her father guiding her aim, she scored four kills before she was retrieved by additional Red Army forces.

          <h2>Sergeant Nikolai Belinski</h2>
          <p>Sergeant Nikolai Belinski (Russian: Николай Белинский) was a Russian soldier who fought in the Red Army, and is a playable main character in Zombies. His player indicator color is blue (shared with Robert McNamara and Robert Englund) but is randomized in Moon and all subsequent maps. An alternate version of Nikolai appears in Origins, and reappears in Call of Duty: Black Ops III, in The Giant, Der Eisendrache, Zetsubou No Shima, Gorod Krovi (which also includes the original timeline Nikolai Belinski), Revelations and Blood of the Dead. This version also appears alongside the original version in the ending cutscene for Classified. Both versions are playable in Alpha Omega, and both versions appear in the cutscenes for Tag der Toten.

        <h2>Khaled Al-Asad</h2>
        <p>Khaled Al-Asad was born on May 1st, 1963 in Saudi Arabia. Later on, He joined the OpFor, which wasn’t a major threat to anybody at the time. He rose through the ranks of the OpFor until he was the main commander of the faction. When he became the commander, he started to wear his signature glasses and beret. At some point, he met Ultranationalist leader Imran Zakhaev and Al-Asad became one of the so called “The Four Horsemen”.
        <br> Al-Asad came to hate the current president, Yasir Al-Fulani, and Zakhaev contacted Al-Asad telling him that he will help him overthrow Al-Fulani in a violent Coup in order to keep the United States and Britain away from the Second Russian Civil War</p>
